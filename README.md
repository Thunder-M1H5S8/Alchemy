AI Poster Generator
A lightweight generative‑AI web tool that helps non‑designers create marketing poster content instantly from simple text prompts. Built in under 24 hours during a hackathon, our project focuses on speed, simplicity, and accessibility.

⭐ Introduction
Designing marketing posters usually requires time, creativity, and familiarity with professional tools — which many users simply don’t have. Students, small businesses, and beginners often struggle to create clear and appealing marketing material quickly.

Our solution removes this barrier. With just a short prompt, our system generates a complete marketing message including a headline, tagline, and call‑to‑action. The results are displayed in a clean poster‑style layout, making marketing content creation fast, simple, and accessible to everyone.
